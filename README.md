## [Text-Summarizer](https://github.com/PrasanthMolleti/Text-Summarizer)

Text Summarizer uses both the TextRank and LexRank algorithms to extract the top 10 statements that capture the context of the text and presents them to understand the text in a concise way for better reading efficiency.

The work can be further developed to take in the links to webpages and provide the text summary by scraping the text-data from the webpage.
And also this is an extractive text summarizer, but it can be further improved by using abstractive text summarization instead of extractive.
